gcfit

Creates an object of class gcfit.
Description
This is a constructor function for the "gcfit" class. This class is most often obtained as the return
value when calling SummarizeGrowth.
Usage
gcfit(gc_vals, log_mod, data_t, data_n)
Arguments
gc_vals An object of class gcvals that contains the summarized metrics from fitting the
growth model to a set of experimental observations. This is where the fitness
proxy parameters can be found. See gcvals for more information the informa-
tion found in this object.
log_mod An object of class nlsModel that contains the results of fitting the logistic growth
model to the data
data_t A numeric vector of times
data_n A numeric vector of cell count or absorbance readings
Value
An object of class gcfit, which is a list of three objects, that combines the parameters (vals = gc_vals,
model = log_mod, data = list(data_t, data_n))gcvals
