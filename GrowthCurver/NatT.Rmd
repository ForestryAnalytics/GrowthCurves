Number of Cells at Time t
Description
This function gives the number of cells or absorbance (N) at time t when the parameters to the
logistic equation are K, N0, and r.
Usage
NAtT(k, n0, r, t)
Arguments
k The carrying capacity
n0 The initial population size (absorbance or individuals)
r The exponential "growth rate"
t The time at which you want to know N
Value
The number of cells, or N, at time t
