Description
Time course of target object fixation during a spoken word-to-picture matching (i.e., "visual world paradigm").



#### Format
A data frame with 300 rows and 7 variables

* Subject : subject ID, factor

* Time : time (in ms) relative to word onset in 50ms bins, 300-1000

* timeBin : rescaling of Time variable for easier model-fitting, 1-15

* Condition : word frequency condition: High (e.g., torch, frog) or Low (e.g., class, horse)

* meanFix : fixation proportion (subject mean): proportion of correct-response trials on which the object was fixated

* sumFix : fixation sum: number of correct-response trials on which the object was fixated (i.e., numerator for meanFix)

* N : number of correct-response trials (i.e., denominator for meanFix)
